      <p>
        I'm Chris Hanson and I started playing video games when I was a freshman in highschool over 8 years ago.
        I'm currently 23 years old and I'm still obsessed with every game I get my hands on. There's not much else I
        find enjoyable aside
        from doing this in my free time.
        I was ranked in the top 0.1% of a game I play often for the past 5 years and intend to keep climbing as much as
        possible
        and as
        often as possible. I really enjoy the competitive nature of gaming and what it brings in terms of keeping me
        occupied outside of schoolwork.

        Best Time to Play

      <h3>
        Anytime!
      </h3>
      <p>
        The wonderful thing about gaming is you can play at any time! It's totally dependant on your schedule and what
        times work best for you.
        There's so much to explore given even the most limited schedule. There's games for every type of person, from
        quick mobile games, to deep
        and extensive fantasy worlds with in-depth story lines and deep character arcs for those who have more time.
