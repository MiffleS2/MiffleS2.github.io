        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve been learning how to blow glass for about one year now. I’ve lived in North Carolina for nine years, but
          was born in Michigan and was raised in Colorado. I’m currently enrolled at CPCC working on my bachelor’s
          degree in computer science. Working with glass is teaching me how to problem solve on the fly. I go from
          manipulating molten glass to grinding paperweights flat to organizing nuts and bolts all within a day. The way
          I approach these problems is always different and has helped me develop a more robust way of breaking down any
          challenge I encounter in the future. Although I’m aiming for computer science and engineering to be my final
          career, I’ve grown in my time working at HGA and I can tell this will be a lifelong endeavor.
