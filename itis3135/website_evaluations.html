      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.playerauctions.com/">Player Auctions</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Player Auctions is a website for video game players to advertise in game services for real
        world money. Whether it be leveling services, in game gold, etc.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Contrast: The contrast of the website flows very well, important information is
          easy to see and readable. Nothing important seems hidden and the colors really pop in
          relation to each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repetition: There's a large amount of repition throughout the website in relation to showing you
          information that is presentable to the reader. Hyperlinks are purple squares, or generally highlighted
          by boxes for viewer readability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alignment: The alignment of the website is very good, everything is generally centered and if it's
          not centered there's an obvious reason for it. There's a nice animation in the middle of the screen
          for the viewer to see and it's not hard to get lost on the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proximity: Spacing is very good throughout the website, the website takes advantage of all screen real-estate,
          at no point do things feel clustered or out of place in my opinion.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Craigslist is a user marketplace where you can sell items, similar to ebay users can meet and trade/sell
        personal belongings and items to each other under this marketplace website.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Contrast: The contrast is good but too simple, the only colors are basic blue hyperlinks and the
          website generally feels uninspired and boring.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repetition: The only repetition on this page is the repeating blue hyperlinks flooding the page.
          Fonts and sizing also seem to be all over the place with no real clear design prinicpal in mind.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alignment: The alignment is fine but generally boring and uninspired, everything throughout is
          just centered without cool pictures or additions to the website to make the most of the real-estate provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proximity: Most of the links are crammed together and hard to read due to the small font size.
        </li>
      </ul>
